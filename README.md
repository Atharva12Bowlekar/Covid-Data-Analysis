# Covid-Data-Analysis

**COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL**

## Overview

This repository contains an SQL script, `Corona.sql`, which facilitates the analysis of COVID-19 related data. The script is designed to work with a relational database containing COVID-19 data, likely sourced from reliable sources such as government health departments or international organizations.

## Contents

1. **Data Retrieval**  
   SQL queries are included to retrieve COVID-19 data from the database. This data may encompass various metrics such as the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, and other pertinent information.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   The script includes SQL queries to transform the raw data into a format conducive to analysis. This involves tasks such as aggregating data by geographical region or time period, calculating derived metrics like infection rates or mortality rates, and cleaning the data to address any discrepancies or missing values.

3. **Data Analysis**  
   The SQL script conducts various analyses on the COVID-19 data. This encompasses identifying trends over time, comparing statistics across different regions or countries, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies on disease transmission, and potentially forecasting future trends based on historical data patterns.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   While not directly present in the SQL script itself, the analysis results can be visualized using dashboards. A **Tableau dashboard** for this analysis is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/atharva.bowlekar/viz/CovidDataAnalysis_17072509329970/Dashboard1), providing interactive charts and graphs to explore key insights.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have access to a relational database containing COVID-19 data.  
2. Execute the SQL script in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.).  
3. Customize the queries as needed to suit your specific analysis requirements, such as adjusting the time period, geographical scope, or metrics of interest.  
4. Analyze the query results and explore the Tableau dashboard to visualize patterns, trends, and insights derived from the data.
